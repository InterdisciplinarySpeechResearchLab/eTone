Created gitignore for ease of unity merging. However, the size of the assets requrie installing git LFS to host on the repo. 
If this is a hassle, I can load the assets seperately from the repository. 

<WARNING> Game has NOT been built yet and thus won't be able to load on other computers without the most recent version of unity.
