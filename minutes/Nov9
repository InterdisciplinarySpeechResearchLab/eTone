Regrets: Alexis Black


Measure accuracy of tone

Choose language at later date

Pitch accuracy tool should be modular

-Software should keep track of date and time of games as well as accuracy.
    Should be collected and stored for experimenters. Later on possibly a leader board.

-Should be able to handle one sentence-length of produced material.

-Pitch tracker features: Filtering, use Log F0, Normal correlation after filtering.

Future 


Issues Ryan will discuss with eNunciate team: 
-Where is eNunciate hosted?
-Where is the previous coding done in Java
-What license does eNunciate use?


UI

-Game should not demonstrate accuracy vertically or time horizontally. Closeness to target
-Simple instructions and simple UI
-"Levelling up:"
  -Sylable -> word -> sentence -> challenging sentence
  -Slow pronunciation -> fast pronunciation
 -Initially one game that would appeal to a broad audience. Possibility of several "skins"?
