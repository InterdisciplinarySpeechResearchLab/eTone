Regrets: Alexis

Game/UI
-Rough prototyping
-Game will be in unity. 
-Jamie presented a cat-based fishing game. Accuracy of pronunciation is represented as cat's accuracy at catching fish.
-Task should be analogous to the motor study.
-Jamie will create a basic level
-Work on passing off data from app to serveer
-Voice input will be captured by Unity (is this true?)
-Gradient accuracy is important. Perhaps the cat's timing in catching the fish or the distance of the leaping cat from the fish.
-Would be best to have different skins. (I think we all agree space is cool). 
-Open-source sprites are ok (I may have the terminology wrong here. Please correct it.)

Linking game to registration and signal processing components
-Registration and login will be in Jango.

Signal processing
-Vaastav has tried out different signal libraries, but requires target stimuli.

Language instruction.
-Ryan/Bryan will choose a language and find some target stimuli.
